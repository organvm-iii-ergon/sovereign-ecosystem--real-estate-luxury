# Planning Guide

The Sovereign Ecosystem is a dual-interface luxury real estate platform that unifies compliance intelligence for agents with a zero-UI, gesture-driven experience for high-net-worth clients.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Exclusivity** - The interface should feel like accessing a private vault, with invite-only access and biometric-simulated authentication that reinforces the premium positioning.
2. **Intelligence** - Proactive compliance monitoring and AI-driven recommendations should operate seamlessly in the background, surfacing insights at precisely the right moment.
3. **Sensory Richness** - Every interaction should provide multi-sensory feedback through sound effects, smooth animations, and tactile-feeling gestures that create a memorable, luxurious experience.

**Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality, likely with multiple views)
This platform requires dual user flows (agent/client), sophisticated compliance logic modules, gesture recognition, real-time calculations, document management, and coordinate state management across local and cloud layers.

Users can also use sliders for precise adjustments. Toggle overlay visibility, fullscreen mode, and info panel independently. **Capture and save AR snapshots directly to Private Vault** with timestamp and property details, or download snapshots directly to device. **Property selection interface** allows choosing any property from portfolio for AR viewing when accessed from main menu (vs auto-selecting when accessed from property card). **Custom Measurement Presets** provide quick access to common measurement types (Room Width, Door Height, Ceiling Height, etc.) with preset labels and default expected lengths. Users can create unlimited custom presets for frequently used measurements. Selecting a preset automatically enables measurement mode and applies the preset label to new measurements.

Shareable links encode property IDs in URL params for easy sharing.
- Purpose: Enables users to revisit important property comparisons without re-selecting properties, track decision-making process over time, and easily share comparison configurations with advisors, partners, or family members. Particularly valuable for users comparing many properties or making decisions over extended periods.

## Design Direction

The design should evoke the feeling of accessing a private, luxurious sanctuary with a sophisticated feminine aesthetic that transforms seamlessly between day and night modes. Every interaction should feel refined and elegant, with soft tactile feedback that makes digital interactions feel gentle yet intentional. The aesthetic balances modern minimalism (soft surfaces, generous whitespace, flowing curves) with luxurious accents (rose gold/moonlit silver, gradient overlays, subtle animations, floating particles). Motion should be purposeful and graceful, never harsh or mechanical - like silk fabric flowing or rose petals falling. The dark mode embraces a moonlit elegance with deep indigo backgrounds, soft lavender accents, and shimmering particle effects that create an ethereal, nocturnal luxury experience.

## Color Selection

The palette creates a soft, ethereal luxury aesthetic with rose-tinted warmth and pearl-like luminosity for light mode, transitioning to a deep moonlit elegance in dark mode with indigo depths and lavender shimmer.

## Animations

Animations should feel graceful and fluid, with easing curves that mimic flowing fabrics, floating petals, and gentle breezes. **Atmospheric particle effects** float across backgrounds in both light and dark modes, creating depth and luxury through connected particle networks with subtle glow effects. **Property cards** feature staggered entrance animations (0.5s delay per card, scale from 0.95), smooth hover lifts (-8px translate with 1.02 scale), and exit animations for seamless transitions. **Theme transitions** between light and dark modes are smooth 700ms color transitions with rotating icon animations. Key moments include: the vault unlocking sequence (2s orchestrated animation with sound), the wax seal stamp (0.8s with gentle settle), pinch-to-summarize (0.3s spring animation), pull-to-search (silk ribbon effect), and the circular yield slider (real-time with gradient shimmer). All transitions use elegant cubic-bezier curves (e.g., [0.16, 1, 0.3, 1]) to create smooth, organic motion. Micro-interactions like button presses have 100ms feedback with subtle scale transforms, while major state changes take 400-600ms with graceful fade and slide combinations. Hover states include gentle lifts and soft glow effects. **Floating background elements** use independent animation loops (15-25s duration) with vertical float, horizontal drift, and opacity pulsing to create a living, breathing atmosphere.
